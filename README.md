# 10 Minute Dynamic Mobile App

In this demo I'm going to create a dynamic mobile application in 10 minutes <sup>give or take, more or less ;)</sup>

## How to do this?

* [Create a REST API with some content](API.md)
* [Create a Mobile APP with some dynamic screens](APP.md)
* [Create a SDK to connect API and APP](SDK.md)

## Requirements

### `node`, `npm` and `nodemon` need to be installed globally.

Refer to [your friend](https://google.com/) on how to do this for your platform.

### Install the tools we are building with
    $ npm install -g loopback
    $ npm install -g ionic
